# Horribly outdated. Use this at your own risk, I have no idea if it still works and I'm not updating it anymore. I might start updating again at one point, but I'm very busy at the moment.
If anyone wants to use the stuff I've done and continue working, be my guest. It's licensed under the WTFPL after all.
